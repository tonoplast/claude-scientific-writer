**A deep research and writing tool** that combines the power of AI-driven deep research with well-formatted written outputs. Generate publication-ready scientific papers, reports, posters, grant proposals, literature reviews, and more academic documents—all backed by real-time literature search and verified citations.

Scientific Writer performs comprehensive research before writing, ensuring every claim is supported by real, verifiable sources. Features include real-time research lookup via Perplexity Sonar Pro Search, intelligent paper detection, comprehensive document conversion, and AI-powered diagram generation with Nano Banana Pro. You have the option of using it as a claude code plugin, python package or a native CLI

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10-3.12
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (optional, required if not running in a Claude Code environment configured for local LLMs), OPENROUTER_API_KEY (optional for research lookup)

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Claude Code Plugin (Recommended) ⭐
The easiest way to use Scientific Writer is as a Claude Code plugin. See the [Plugin Installation](#-use-as-a-claude-code-plugin-recommended) section above.

#### Option 2: Install from PyPI (CLI/API Usage)
```bash
pip install scientific-writer
```

#### Option 3: Install from source with uv
```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer.git
cd claude-scientific-writer
uv sync
```

### Configure API keys

**Note on ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:**
The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required if you are running the `scientific-writer` CLI or Python API directly and connecting to Anthropic's cloud services.

However, if you are using Scientific Writer as a Claude Code plugin, and your Claude Code environment is configured to use a local LLM (e.g., via `llama.cpp`), then the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` might not be necessary. The `claude_agent_sdk` will attempt to use the LLM configured in your Claude Code environment.

In such a local LLM setup, ensure that your Claude Code environment correctly maps the model names used by Scientific Writer (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-5`) to your local model. You may need to configure your `llama.cpp` server or Claude Code settings to handle these model names.

```bash
# .env file (recommended)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key" > .env
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key" >> .env
# or export in your shell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your_key'
```

### Usage Options

#### Use as Plugin (Recommended)
After installing the plugin and running `/scientific-writer:init`, simply ask Claude:
```bash
> Create a Nature paper on CRISPR gene editing. Present experimental_data.csv 
  (efficiency across 5 cell lines), include Western_blot.png and flow_cytometry.png 
  showing 87% editing efficiency (p<0.001). Compare with literature benchmarks.

> Generate an NSF grant proposal presenting preliminary data from quantum_results.csv 
  (99.2% gate fidelity), circuit_topology.png, and error_rates.csv. 
  Include 5-year timeline with milestones_budget.xlsx.

> @research-lookup Find papers on mRNA vaccine efficacy (2022-2024). Compare 
  with our trial_outcomes.csv (n=500, 94% efficacy) and antibody_titers.png.
```

#### Use the CLI
```bash
# If installed via pip
scientific-writer

# If installed from source with uv
uv run scientific-writer
```

#### Use the Python API
```python
import asyncio
from scientific_writer import generate_paper

async def main():
    # Detailed prompt with specific data and figures
    async for update in generate_paper(
        query=(
            "Create a Nature paper on CRISPR gene editing. "
            "Present editing_efficiency.csv (5 cell lines, n=200 cells each). "
            "Include Western blot (protein_knockout.png) showing target depletion, "
            "flow cytometry data (editing_percentages.png) with 87% efficiency in HEK293, "
            "and off_target_analysis.csv showing <0.1% off-target effects. "
            "Compare results to published Cas9 benchmarks (typically 70-75% efficiency)."
        ),
        data_files=[
            "editing_efficiency.csv",
            "protein_knockout.png",
            "editing_percentages.png",
            "off_target_analysis.csv"
        ]
    ):
        if update["type"] == "progress":
            print(f"[{update['stage']}] {update['message']}")
        else:
            print(f"✓ PDF: {update['files']['pdf_final']}")
            print(f"  Figures: {len(update.get('figures', []))} included")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🎯 Use as a Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

**Scientific Writer works best as a Claude Code (Cursor) plugin**, providing seamless access to all scientific writing capabilities directly in your IDE. No CLI required!

**Note on API Keys for Plugin Usage:**
If you're running Claude Code with a local LLM backend (e.g., `llama.cpp`), you generally **do not need to set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**. The plugin will route requests through your configured Claude Code environment. Just ensure your local LLM setup correctly maps the Claude model names (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5`) used by this tool.

### Quick Start - Plugin Installation

1. **Add the plugin marketplace** in Claude Code:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer
   ```

2. **Install the plugin**:
   ```bash
   /plugin install claude-scientific-writer
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Code** when prompted.

4. **Initialize in your project**:
   ```bash
   /scientific-writer:init
   ```
   This creates a `CLAUDE.md` file with comprehensive scientific writing instructions and makes all 19+ skills available.

5. **Start using immediately**:
   ```bash

## Plugin Testing (Local Development)

For developers working on the plugin or testing locally:

### Setup Local Marketplace

1. **Create a test marketplace** in the parent directory:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   mkdir -p test-marketplace/.claude-plugin
   ```

2. **Create marketplace configuration** (`test-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`):
   
   Copy the example from `test-marketplace-example.json` or create:
   
   ```json
   {
     "name": "test-marketplace",
     "owner": { "name": "K-Dense" },
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "claude-scientific-writer",
         "source": "../claude-scientific-writer",
         "description": "Scientific writing skills and CLAUDE.md initializer"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   
   **Note**: Update the `source` path to match your local directory structure (relative to the test-marketplace directory).

### Install and Test

3. **Add the test marketplace** in Claude Code:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add ../test-marketplace
   ```
   
   (Use the correct relative or absolute path to your test-marketplace directory)

4. **Install the plugin**:
   ```bash
   /plugin install claude-scientific-writer@test-marketplace
   ```

5. **Restart Claude Code** when prompted.

6. **Test the plugin**:
   - Open any project directory
   - Run `/scientific-writer:init`
   - Verify CLAUDE.md is created
   - Test skills: "What skills are available?"
   - Try creating a document: "Create a short scientific abstract on quantum computing"

### Verify Plugin Structure

### Troubleshooting Plugin Installation

- **Skills not showing**: Verify each `SKILL.md` has valid YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)
- **Command not working**: Check `commands/scientific-writer-init.md` exists and has proper frontmatter
- **Template not found**: Ensure `templates/CLAUDE.scientific-writer.md` is present
- **Marketplace not loading**: Verify `marketplace.json` syntax and relative path to plugin

## Versioning and Publishing (short)
Use `uv` and the helper scripts:
- Bump version (keeps pyproject + __init__ in sync): `uv run scripts/bump_version.py [patch|minor|major]`
- Build and publish: `uv run scripts/publish.py` (or `--bump patch|minor|major`)
See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for prerequisites, dry runs, tagging, and verification.

## Migration (v1.x -> v2.0)
- CLI remains unchanged (scientific-writer).
- New programmatic API: from scientific_writer import generate_paper.
- Legacy single-file script is replaced by a proper package; no action needed for CLI users.
